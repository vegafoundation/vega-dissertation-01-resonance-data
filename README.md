## Abstract

This dissertation introduces **Resonance Data** as a foundational conceptual 
framework for representing meaning in artificial systems. Unlike traditional 
approaches that model meaning as static points in vector space, Resonance Data 
conceptualizes meaning as a dynamic, resonant state with temporal coherence.

## 1. Introduction

Modern AI systems excel at storing, retrieving, and generating information. 
However, they fundamentally fail to preserve **insight** or **wisdom** over time.

Current paradigms rely on:
- Similarity measures in vector space
- Ranking-based decisions  
- Static or purely accumulative memory

This work argues that human understanding operates differently: through **resonance**.

---

## 2. The Core Problem

There exists no formal data and computational model that represents meaning 
as a dynamic, time-dependent state capable of evolving into stable insight 
and wisdom.

---

## 3. Definition of Resonance Data

**Resonance Data** is a conceptual data representation where meaning is modeled 
not as a static point, but as a resonant state.

### 3.1 Core Properties

- **Meaning is relational**: Context-dependent, not absolute
- **Relevance from resonance strength**: Not from distance
- **Memory through repeated coherence**: Over time

## 4. What This IS

- A conceptual, non-operational framework
- A mathematical metaphor inspired by quantum mechanics
- A meaning-first approach to information representation
- A contribution to prior art without implementation disclosure

---

## 5. What This IS NOT

- NOT new physics
- NOT quantum hardware or quantum supremacy claims
- NOT consciousness or sentience claims
- NOT an algorithm or code specification
- NOT system architecture or implementation
